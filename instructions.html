        <strong
          >When you load the game you will be dealt a hand of two cards as shown
          below and will have the options to Hit or Hold.</strong

      <p>
        <strong
          >If you choose to Hit you will be dealt another card and it's value
          will be added to your points.</strong

        <strong>
          If you hit and manage to get a total of 21 points you will
          automatically win the game!
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p style="color: red">
        <strong>
          Be careful though because if your points go above 21 you will go bust
          and lose the game!

          the Dealer.</strong

        <strong>
          After Dealer's cards are dealt there are three possible outcomes for
          the player:
        </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3 style="color: #2f9e44"><strong>Win:</strong></h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
              This will happen if either the dealer goes bust or if at the end
              of the game the player has more points than the dealer.
            </strong>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 style="color: red"><strong>Lose:</strong></h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
              This will happen if at the end of the game the dealer has more
              points than the player.
            </strong>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 style="color: blue"><strong>Draw:</strong></h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
              This will happen if at the end of the game the dealer and the
              player have the same amount of points.
            </strong>
